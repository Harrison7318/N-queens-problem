# N-queens-problem
A machine learning program using the simulated annealing technique to solve the 8 queens problem. Board size and number of queens can be adjusted, thus n queens instead of 8 queens.
Built in c++, load both .cpp and board.h into your IDE and make sure you have the '#include "board.h"' above main.
Queens are initially placed randomly in each column than the algorithm takes it from there.
Most of the work is done in board.h including the building of the boards, shifting of queens, and simulated annealing.
If you want to edit the starting temperature (number of iterations on a single board) change it in the constructor of board.
